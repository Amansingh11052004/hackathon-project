            <h2>The Divinity of Varanasi</h2>
            <p>
                For Hindus, Varanasi represents a portal to salvation. Thousands of devotees flock to the city every day, seeking blessings and spiritual cleansing in the sacred waters of the Ganges. One of the key beliefs is that dying in Varanasi and being cremated along the banks of the Ganges breaks the cycle of rebirth and grants moksha (liberation of the soul). The city's ghats, especially <strong>Manikarnika Ghat</strong> and <strong>Harishchandra Ghat</strong>, are famed for cremation rituals, which are said to be the most sacred in Hinduism.
